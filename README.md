# My CodeWars Solutions

- This repository contains my solutions to various CodeWars challenges. Each challenge has its own directory, which contains the code for my solution.

## Usage

- To run the code for a particular challenge, navigate to the directory for that challenge and run the code in the appropriate programming language. For example, to run the code for a Java challenge, you would need to compile the Java file and then run the compiled class file.
